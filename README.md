# Brainwave - A Saas application

Brainwave - It is basically a compilation of multiple ai tools which is provided by the platform OnDemand. It includes various tools which is helpful in daily life. For example: A chat conversation, Image generation, Video generation, audio generation and code completion.

# OnDemand :

OnDemand is a powerful Al platform designed for developers, researchers, and businesses to access an array of Al models and tools that enhance the capability and functionality of language models that we use everyday. Our platform allows users to incorporate generative Al into their upcoming or pre existing systems by making use of Agents.

We offer over 150 agents through the marketplace but also provide users with the ability to build their own. These agents can then work individually or alongside others with a variety of language models that we offer or that are available through hugging face.

You're then able to test and fine tune your Generative Al Chatbots directly in OnDemand before then exporting the code and incorporating your chat bot into your very own applications.
